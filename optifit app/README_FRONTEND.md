## Screenshots

*(Coming Soon: Add screenshots of the app here to showcase the UI.)*

## Architecture

The app is built using the Flutter framework and follows a standard project structure. Key architectural patterns include:

- **State Management:** (Describe the state management solution used, e.g., Provider, BLoC, Riverpod).
- **Service-Based Architecture:** Services are used to encapsulate business logic and interact with the backend API.
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM):** The UI is separated from the business logic using the MVVM pattern.
